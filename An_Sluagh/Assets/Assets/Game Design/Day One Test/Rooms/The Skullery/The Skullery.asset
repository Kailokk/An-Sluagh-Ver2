  openingDescription: 'You can see the ocean stretch out from the kitchen window,
    calm as a slumbering child. The sun shines through the clouds, casting it''s
    beams down like a fisherman''s spear.



    The small scullery kitchen is neat
    and tidy. The few utensils you have are held on a rack above the small food preparation
    area, next to the wash basin.'
  closingDescription: 'The old wooden front door that leads outside is to your left.



    You
    can''t see The Loved One from here, you''ll have to enter the bedroom to check
    on them'
