  Text: "You awaken with a hard thud. The cold stone floor meets you in place of
    the ocean. You take a moment to let the disorientation pass. \r\n\r\nYou lift
    yourself from the floor, and brush off the dust. The sunlight barely graces the
    edge of the one window in the room. It's early in the day."
