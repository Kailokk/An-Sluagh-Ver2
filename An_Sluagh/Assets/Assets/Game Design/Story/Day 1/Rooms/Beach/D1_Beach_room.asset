  openingDescription: 'The Tide has receded passed the stone-laden upper portion
    of the beach.

    Gentle waves lap against the sandy shore. The sky is clear
    and beams of sunlight shine down onto the subdued ocean.'
  closingDescription: 'You can see further down the beach, where the entrance to
    the cave is, obfuscated slightly by an out-cropping in the cliff side.

    

    The
    path back up to the cottage is  visible through the tall reeds at the edge of
    the beach.'
