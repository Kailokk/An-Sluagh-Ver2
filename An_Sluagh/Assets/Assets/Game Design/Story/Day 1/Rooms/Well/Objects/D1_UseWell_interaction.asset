  interactionDescription: 'You tie your bucket to the rope, and lower it down into
    the well.


    As you hoist it up you notice a large black feather, like that
    of a crow, only much bigger than any crow feather you''ve seen before. You remove
    the feather and examine it closer.

    It''s a very intresting subject, but
    you don''t have the time to show it to someone now. You stuff it in your pocket.'
